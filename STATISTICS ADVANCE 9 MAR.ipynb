    "ANSWER : The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both mathematical functions used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PMF is a function that maps each possible value of a discrete random variable to its probability of occurrence. The sum of the probabilities over all possible values of the random variable is equal to 1. For example, let's consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF of this die assigns a probability of 1/6 to each of the possible values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a PDF is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike a PMF, a PDF does not give the probability of specific values of the random variable but gives the probability density at each point in the distribution. The area under the curve of a PDF over an interval represents the probability of the variable falling within that interval. For example, let's consider a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The PDF of this distribution is given by the formula f(x) = (1/√(2π)) * e^(-x^2/2), where x is a continuous variable. The area under the curve between any two values of x represents the probability of the variable falling within that interval.\n",

    "In summary, a PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable, while a PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable.    "

    "ANSWER : The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a continuous probability distribution that is widely used as a model in many fields, including statistics, physics, engineering, and social sciences. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",

    "In finance, the normal distribution is often used to model stock prices, as returns on stocks are often assumed to be normally distributed.\n",

    "In quality control, the normal distribution is used to model the distribution of measurement errors, such as the distribution of weights of manufactured products.\n",

    "The shape of the normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped, with the peak of the curve at the mean. The standard deviation determines the width of the distribution, with larger values of σ resulting in wider distributions. As σ approaches zero, the normal distribution becomes more and more peaked, approaching a point at the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is also sometimes parameterized using the variance (σ^2) instead of the standard deviation. The variance determines the spread of the distribution in the same way as the standard deviation, but is squared in order to maintain the same units as the data being modeled.\n",
